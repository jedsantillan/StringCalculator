# StringCalculator
A console C# application that can solve mathematical expression. It can handle square root, exponents, division, multiplication,subtract.ion
and addition.

Once you run the application you can directly  key-in your math expression. Do take note that it follows a hierarchy of operation where
square root is the highest priority followed by exponents, division, multiplication, subtraction and addition.

The following are the list of symbols used for math operations:

<ul>
<li> sqrt()  - square root [example: sqrt(16)] </li>
<li> ^       - exponent [example: 2^2] </li>
<li> /       - division [example: 4/2] </li>
<li> *       - multiplication [example: 3*2] </li>
<li> -       - subtraction [example: 2-1] </li>
<li> +       - addition [examploe: 5+1] </li>
</ul>
Sample expression used:
10+2*4/2+sqrt(25)-3^2
 -- that will give you a result of 10
