# StringCalculator
a console C# application that can solve mathematical expression. It can handle square root, exponents, division, multiplication,subtract.ion
and addition.

Once you run the application you can directly  key-in your math expression. Do take note that it follows a hierarchy of operation where
square root is the highest priority followed by exponents, division, multiplication, subtraction and addition.

The following are the list of symbols used for math operations:
sqrt()  - square root [example: sqrt(16)]
^       - exponent [example: 2^2]
/       - division [example: 4/2]
*       - multiplication [example: 3*2]
-       - subtraction [example: 2-1]
+       - addition [examploe: 5+1]

Sample expression used:
10+2*4/2+sqrt(25)-3^2
 -- that will give you a result of 10
